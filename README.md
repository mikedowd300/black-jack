So I just created a Trello board, added some stories and made the board public. I admit that making the board after I am a thousand line or so lines in isn't the way to do it, but it is what it is and that's what I did. I must admit though that as I thought through the stories, I realized I need to do a bit of a refactor, so its already working.
If you are still reading and want to see the board it's at: https://trello.com/b/I7aSST9n/black-jack.

I plan on putting some documentation here as to the Game Objects I am creating. It's gonna be awesome.
